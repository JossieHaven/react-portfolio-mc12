                Hello!! My name is <strong>Jossie</strong>, and this is my portfolio. 
                I'm a passionate beginner web developer eager to build creative and 
                functional websites. With a strong curiosity for different programming 
                languages, I'm constantly learning how to craft interactive user experiences. 
                Currently, I'm exploring <strong>React, Node.js, and APIs</strong> to enhance 
                my front-end and back-end skills.
            </p>

            <p style={{ marginTop: "20px" }}>
                I love solving problems, experimenting with new technologies, and bringing 
                ideas to life through code. My goal is to develop <strong>clean, responsive, 
                and user-friendly applications</strong> while continuously improving my skills. 
                As I grow in my web development journey, I'm excited to take on new challenges, 
                collaborate with others, and contribute to real-world projects.
            </p>
